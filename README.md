# compression

### Work in Progress

This package is used for compressing several JSONs into a single compressed binary file, so that it can be made available during load.

The main purpose is to package JSONs so that we can load just one file rather than several small JSON files, thus boosting load time for Web based games.

It's used in the game [World of Turtle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2258040/World_of_Turtle/). ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2258040/World_of_Turtle/), [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/870575), [Itch.io](https://jacklehamster.itch.io/world-of-turtle-remaster))
